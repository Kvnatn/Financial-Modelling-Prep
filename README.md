# Financial Modelling Prep API script and python dashboard project example

## How to use Financial Modelling Prep API with script example and interactive dashboard with python Dash

Financial Modelling Prep is one of the most used API provider in the finance sphere. Its wide range of data is very helpful to cover a big picture of what is happening in the financial world. However, because its data comes in a JSON format, it requires some transformation and cleaning to be fully exploited in a project.

The several part of this project will help you:
* Use the API globally
* Understand the different kind of data available in the API from a financial point of view
* Clean the data from API call
* Transform the data in a useable format
* Explore data visually using several library
* Create an interactive dashboard
