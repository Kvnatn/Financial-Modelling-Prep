    "There are different organizations that have come up with unique methods and formulas to calculate the ESG score of publicly traded companies, analyzing whether they effectively meet the current ESG standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A good example can be how Financial Modeling Prep conducts ESG ratings. The organization compiles publicly available data of different companies. The data harnessed is relevant to a business entity’s exposure to concerns and risks that are primarily industry-specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This typically involves data on how large its operations are and where the company operates. Based on these factors, Financial Modeling Prep assigns a value against that company’s ESG risks, comparing that company to other players in the industry, assigning a AAA (excellent ESG rating) or a CCC rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Awarding an ESG score to a company gives investors an opportunity to diligently and transparently compare different performance track records between several companies in various industries and sectors. There are three components of an ESG score:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Environmental Factor: This ESG score considers a business’s environmental impact, evaluating the amount of carbon emissions made, the steps taken to reduce their carbon footprint, invest in biodiversity, reduce pollution, and they’re continuous strive to adopt greener technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Social Factor: This component considers a company’s openness to investing in a more diversified workplace, whether or not they have teams of motivated and satisfied employees, are engaged in charity, are inclusive, and condemn discrimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Governance Factor: This analyses whether or not the company has an independent board, good overall corporate culture, executive pay, solid ethics, are not involved in bribery or corruption, and are advocates of transparency.\n",
